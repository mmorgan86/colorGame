# colorGame
Color game project I made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Colors is small interactive game in which the player is presented with a percentage 
combination of colors in RGB components and based on that the player tries to guess the correct color. 
Basically, You can think it like mixing of three diffrent colors red,Green and blue 
after which You will get another color.
